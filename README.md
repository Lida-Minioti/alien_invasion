# alien_invasion
This is a repository to enable version control for the alien invasion project as described in the book  "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Only a couple of versions will be created for practice as the code was created locally without using git.

Python version used: 3.10.4
To run the project, install the libraries as described in the requirements .txt [potentially use: pip install -r requirements.txt].
